# RehaBrain
A free cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) software made for people with neurodegenerative diseases.

## Goal
RehaBrain is developed to help people with neurodegenerative diseases using CST (cognitive stimulation therapy), trying to improve their current cognitive abilities.
RehaBrain is developed to be **customizable** based on final user's interests and knowledge.
The final goal is helping people who care relatives or friends with neurodegenerative diseases by providing them free CST tools.

## Why developing a new software?
There isn't much free CST software that can be **personalized** (based on person-specific criteria) on the internet. RehaBrain data is made to be fully customizable and it could be based on user's interests and knowledge.

## How it works?
RehaBrain has **5** _(for now)_ different CST actvities, which are:
1. **Matching a word to an object**<br>
   For example: matching the image representing a fork with the word "fork" written on the screen.
2. **Selecting all the images in a particular category**<br>
   For example: matching all the images (present on the screen) which are attributable to the category "kitchen", like a fork, a glass and so on.
3. **Writing rhymes**<br>
   For example: writing all 

## Development principles
### Language and framework
RehaBrain is written in Java with the use of the Processing framework for the GUI.
