# RehaBrain
A free cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) software made for people with neurodegenerative diseases.

## Goal
RehaBrain is developed to help people with neurodegenerative diseases using CST (cognitive stimulation therapy), trying to improve their current cognitive abilities.
RehaBrain is developed to be **customizable** based on final user's interests and knowledge.

## Why developing a new software?
There isn't much free CST software that can be **personalized** (based on person-specific criteria) on the internet. RehaBrain data is made to be fully customizable and it could be based on user's interests and knowledge.
